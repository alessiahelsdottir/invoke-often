\addchap{Hymn to Satan}

\begin{Verse}
I \textsc{Adore} Thee, King of Evil,\\
By the body Thou hast fashioned\\
In the likeness of a devil\\
By its purity impassioned\\
I adore Thee, King of Evil!

I adore Thee, Lord of Malice,\\
By the soul that Thou hast moulded\\
Lovely as a lily-chalice\\
To the sombre sun unfolded.\\
I adore Thee, Lord of Malice!

By its thirst, the cruel craving\\
For things infinite, unheard-of,\\
Dream devouring and depraving,\\
Songs no God may guess a word of,\\
Songs of crime and songs of craving ---

By the drear eyes of the devil\\
Bleak and sterile as they glitter\\
I adore Thee, King of Evil,\\
With these lips, as dry and bitter\\
As the drear eyes of the devil!

I adore Thee, I invoke Thee,\\
I abase myself before Thee,\\
By the spells that once awoke the \\
Lust of Chaos I adore Thee, \\
I adore Thee, I Invoke Thee!
