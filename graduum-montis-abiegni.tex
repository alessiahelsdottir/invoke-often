\addsec*{A Syllabus of the Steps Upon the Path}

51. Let not the failure and the pain turn aside the worshippers. The
foundations of the pyramid were hewn in the living rock ere sunset; did the
king weep at dawn that the crown of the pyramid was yet unquarried in the
distant land?

52. There was also an humming-bird that spake unto the horned cerastes,
and prayed him for poison. And the great snake of Khem the Holy One, the
royal Ur\ae{}us serpent, answered him and said:

53. I sailed over the sky of Nu in the car called Millions-of-Years, and I saw
not any creature upon Seb that was equal to me. The venom of my fang is
the inheritance of my father, and of my fatherâ€™s father; and how shall I give
it unto thee? Live thou and thy children as I and my fathers have lived, even
unto an hundred millions of generations, and it may be that the mercy of the
Mighty Ones may bestow upon thy children a drop of the poison of eld.

54. Then the humming-bird was afflicted in his spirit, and he flew unto the flowers, and it was as if nought had been spoken between them. Yet in a little while, a serpent struck him that he died.

55. But an Ibis that meditated upon the bank of Nile the beautiful god
listened and heard. And he laid aside his Ibis ways, and became as a serpent
saying Peradventure in an hundred millions of millions of generations of my
children, they shall attain to a drop of the poison of the fang of the Exalted
One.

56. And behold! ere the moon waxed thrice he became an Ur\ae{}us serpent, and the poison of the fang was established in him and his seed even for ever and for ever.

(NOTE. This is in truth the sole task; the others are useful only as adjuvants to and preparations for the One Work.

Moreover, once this task has been accomplished, there is no more need of human help or instruction; for by this alone may the highest attainment be reached.

All these grades are indeed but convenient landmarks, not necessarily significant. A person who had attained them all might be immeasurably the inferior of one who had attained none of them; it is Spiritual Experience alone that counts in Result; the rest is but Method.

Yet it is important to possess knowledge and power, provided that it be devoted wholly to that One Work.)
