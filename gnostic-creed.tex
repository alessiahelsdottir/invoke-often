\chapnum{Fragment from Liber XV\footnote{Magick in Theory and Practice}}

\begin{verse}
  I believe in one secret and ineffable \textsc{Lord}; and in one Star in the Company of Stars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall return; and in one Father of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in His name \textsc{Chaos}\index{Chaos}, the sole viceregent of the Sun upon the Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all that breathes. \\

  And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein all men are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her name \textsc{Babalon}\index{Babalon}. \\

  And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in his name \textsc{Baphomet}. \\

  And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life, Love, and Liberty, the Word of whose law is \textsc{\textgreek{Θελ\nolinebreakημα}}. \\

  And I believe in the communion of Saints. \\

  And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into spiritual substance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass. \\

  And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom whereby we accomplish the Miracle of Incarnation. \\

  And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that was, and is, and is to come. \\
