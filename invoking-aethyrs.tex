\addchap{Method of Invoking the \AEthyr{}s}
\epigraph{And now, after so long a while, the Angel lifts me, and takes me from the room, and sets me in a little chamber where is another Angel like a fair youth in shining garments, who makes me partake of the sacraments; bread, that is labour; and fire, that is wit; and a rose, that is sin; and wine, that is death. And all about us is a great company of angels in many-coloured robes, rose and spring-green, and sky-blue, and pale gold, and silver, and lilac, solemnly chanting without words. It is music wonderful beyond all that can be thought. And now we go out of the chamber; on the right is a pylon, and the right figure is Isis, and the left figure Nephthys, and they are folding their wings over, and supporting Ra.

I wanted to go back to the King's Chamber. The Angel pushed me away, saying: \enquote{Thou shalt see these visions from afar off, but thou shalt not partake of them save in the manner prescribed. For if thou change so much as the style of a letter, the holy word is blasphemed.}}{\textsc{The Vision of the 18th \AEthyr{}.}}

\textbf{And this is the manner prescribed:}\footnote{A portion of the Vision and the Voice, from the Equinox Vol. I, No. 5. It was not in the 'Class D' section of the \Argentium{} syllabus, but instead a note on the Vision and the Voice itself marked it as an official ritual/instruction.}

Let there be a room furnished as for the ritual of passing through the Tuat.\editorsnote{There are versions of this ritual online, but it was not publicly extant at the time of the rest of these publications (by 1929). Please see the next chapter, the instructions from the 8th \AEthyr{}, for an appropriate temple setup.} And let the aspirant be clad in the robes of, and let him bear the insignia of, his grade. And at the least he shall be a neophyte.

Three days and three nights shall he have been in the tomb, vigilant and fasting, for he shall sleep no longer than three hours at any one time, and he shall drink pure water, and eat little sweet cakes consecrated unto the moon, and fruits, and the eggs of the duck, or of the goose, or of the plover. And he shall be shut in, so that no man may break in upon his meditation. But in the last twelve hours he shall neither eat nor sleep.

Then shall he break his fast, eating rich food, and drinking sweet wines, and wines that foam; and he shall banish the elements and the planets and the signs and the sephiroth; and then shall he take the holy table that he hath made for his altar, and he shall take the call of the \AEthyr{} of which he will partake, which he hath written in the angelic character, or in the character 01 the holy alphabet that is revealed in Pop\'{e}, upon a fair sheet of virgin vellum; and therewith shall he conjure the \AEthyr{}, chanting the call. And in the lamp that is hung above the altar shall he burn the call that he hath written.

Then shall he kneel before the holy table, and it shall be given him to partake of the mystery of the\AEthyr{}.

And concerning the ink with which he shall write; for the first \AEthyr{} let it be gold, for the second scarlet, for the third violet, for the fourth emerald, for the fifth silver, for the sixth sapphire, for the seventh orange, for the eighth indigo, for the ninth gray, for the tenth black, for the eleventh maroon, for the twelfth russet, for the thirteenth green-gray, for the fourteenth amber, for the fifteenth olive, {or the sixteenth pale blue, for the seventeenth crimson, for the eighteenth bright yellow, for the nineteenth crimson adorned with silver, for the twentieth mauve, for the twenty-first pale green, for the twenty-second rose-madder, for the twenty-third violet cobalt, for the twenty-fourth beetle-brown, blue-brown colour, for the twenty fifth a cold dark gray, for the twenty-sixth white ï¬‚ecked with red, blue, and yellow; the edges of the letters shall be green, for the twenty-seventh angry clouds of ruddy brown, for the twenty-eighth indigo, for the twenty-ninth bluish-green, for the thirtieth mixed colours,

This shall be the form to be used by him who would partake of the mystery of any \AEthyr{}. And let him not change so much as the style 01 a letter, lest the holy word be blasphemed. And let him beware, after he hath been permitted to partake 01 this mystery, that he await the completion 01 the gist hour of his retirement, before he open the door of the place of his retirement; lest he contaminate his glory with uncleanness, and lest they that behold him be smitten by his glory unto death.

For this is a holy mystery, and he that did first attain to reveal the alphabet thereof, perceived not one ten-thousandth part of the fringe that is upon its vesture.
