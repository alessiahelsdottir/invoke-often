\addsec*{Theorems}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
\item The world progresses by virtue of the appearance of Christs (geniuses).
\item Christs (geniuses) are men\editorsnote{\textit{I.e.} people.} with super-consciousness of the highest order.
\item Super-consciousness of the highest order is obtainable by known methods.
\item[] Therefore, by employing the quintessence of known methods we cause the world to progress.
\end{enumerate}

\addsec*{Essentials of Method}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
\item Theology is immaterial; for both Buddha and St. Ignatius were Christs.
\item Morality is immaterial; for both Socrates and Mohammed were Christs.
\item Super-consciousness is a natural phenomenon; its conditions are therefore to be sought rather in the acts than the words of those who attained it.
\item[] The essential acts are retirement and concentration --- as taught by Yoga and Ceremonial Magic.
\end{enumerate}

\addsec*{Mistakes of Mystics}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
\item Since truth is supra-rational, it is incommunicable in the language of reason.
\item Hence all mystics have written nonsense, and what sense they have written is so far untrue.
\item Yet as a still lake yields a truer reflection of the sun than a torrent, he whose mind is best balanced will, if he becomes a mystic, become the best mystic.
\end{enumerate}

\addsec*{The Method of Equilibrium}
\subsection*{I. The Passions, etc.}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
\item Since the ultimate truth of teleology is unknown, all codes of morality are arbitrary.
\item Therefore the student has no concern with ethics as such.
\item He is consequently free \enquote{to do his duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call him.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{II. The Reason}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]
\item Since truth is supra-rational, any rational statement is false.
\item Let the student then contradict every proposition that presents itself to him.
\item Rational ideas being thus expelled from the mind, there is room for the apprehension of spiritual truth.
\item[] It should be remarked that this does not destroy the validity of reasonings on their own plane.
\end{enumerate}
