\addchap{Note about editor's rituals}
\footnotetext[99]{These statements and variations are in no way endorsed by any of these organisations or authors.}

The following included rituals are Left-Hand Path variations on the traditional rituals of the Qabalistic Cross and the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. They were based on the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, the Star Ruby, the Gnostic Ritual of the Pentagram\footnote{Peter Carroll's \textit{Liber Kaos}}, the Banishing Rite of the Dark Lord\footnote{theisticsatanism.com \textemdash{} \textit{Basic Satanic Rites and Exercises} by Stephen Bleach}, and so on.

Correspondences used have been informed by Aleister Crowley's \textit{777} and Thomas Karlsson's \textit{Qabalah, Qliphoth, and Goetic Magic}. Terms \enquote{black flame} and \enquote{world of horrors} derive from Temple of Set writings, such as those by Michael Aquino and Don Webb.

The infernal names of the quarters in the Lesser Ritual of the Averse Pentagram are derived from the Church of Satan writings, such as \textit{The Satanic Bible} and \textit{The Satanic Rituals}, which in themselves are derived from the four Crown Princes of Hell in the \textit{Book of Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage}.

The averse pentagrams themselves are as in \textit{Liber V vel Reguli}.

These are further included as an example of how one may construct their own rituals using the information in Liber O and 777 \textemdash{} create one attuned to your own nature!

\textit{The word of sin is Restriction.}
