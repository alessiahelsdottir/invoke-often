  \begin{Verse}
  This is the Holy Hexagram. \\
  Plunge from the height, O God, and interlock with Man! \\
  Plunge from the height, O Man, and interlock with Beast! \\
  The Red Triangle is the descending tongue of grace; the Blue Triangle is the ascending tongue of prayer. \\
  This Interchange, the Double Gift of Tongues, the Word of Double Power \textemdash{} \textsc{Abrahadabra!\index{Formul\ae{}!ABRAHADABRA}} \textemdash{} is the sign of the GREAT WORK, for the GREAT WORK is accomplished in Silence. And behold is not that Word equal to Cheth, that is Cancer, whose Sigil is \cancer{}? \\
  This Work also eats up itself, accomplishes its own end, nourishes the worker, leaves no seed, is perfect in itself. \\
  Little children, love one another! \\
  \end{Verse}
