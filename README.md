_Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law._

---

'Invoke Often!' is an open-source collection of Aleister Crowley's instructions and rituals, transcribed from the Equinox and Book of Lies available on [Keep Silence](https://keepsilence.org/the-equinox/) as well as the 1929 edition of Magick, both on Keep Silence and [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/b29825064). It is my hope that this will be reviewed and improved on by the Thelemic community as a freely available resource for all aspirants. Pull requests and issue reports are very welcome! 

Its official website is hosted here on [Github](https://invokeoften.github.io/book/)

## Physical copies

In the event you would like a hard copy of the book, please print it from the PDF via your chosen printer. It is no longer available from me directly. If you would like to donate to the project, please feel free to use Github Sponsors for a one-time donation, but, preferably, donate directly to the Keep Silence project, linked above.

Steps to print on Lulu:

- Create a Lulu account
- Create a project as a private publication
- Upload the pdf
- Create a cover you like
- Place an order
